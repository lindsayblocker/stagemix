Each card has each of the following:
Score - an accumulation of their ratings in each of the five categories: dance, vocal, visual, personality, and stage presence
Ability - the background color represents each character’s unique ability, whether they are a vocalist, dancer, visual, personality or all-rounder
Rank - characters are ranked from S tier to C tier. The function of this ranking is to help the player quickly see the value of each card during the game.

Stage Card:
A stage card sets the field effects of each round. They represent the event that each team will be judged on. Cards with an ability that is highlighted by the stage cards will be granted bonus points. For example, Chaeryeong’s score would become a 10.4 because of the two point boost that the Award Show Stage Card grants dancers. There are nine stage cards: Award Show, Meet & Greet, Comeback Stage, Acting Gig, SBS Radio, Variety Show, Yeol’s Sketchbook, Show Me the Money, Studio Choom, and Solo


At the beginning of a round, a random stage card is chosen. Then each player will draw five cards facing down. Every turn, the players are allowed to make one of three moves: flip a card, draw a card, or discard a card. The player must always have exactly five cards in their deck. The game will progress until a player flips over their last card. Once all cards are revealed, the total score will be calculated and the player with the highest total score wins the round.The strategy is to balance the amount of high base-score cards with the round’s ability-boost cards.

Even though Dahyun’s base ranking is lower than Soobin’s, if the round’s Stage Card is a Meet & Greet, then their scores would be the same.
